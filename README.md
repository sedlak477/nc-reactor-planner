# NC Reactor Planner

A collection of tools for creating Nuclearcraft reactors.

I create this project mainly for learning Angular and web development, so don't expect
too much.

## Contribution / Ideas

If you have an ideas or want to contribute to the project, **create a new issue** to discuss the idea or proposed
changes. If all is well create a PR and I'll merge it.

### Coding Style/Guidelines

I personally don't really enforce strict style/guidelines. Just keep the code clean and readable so it's
easy to go back and use it as a reference for future Angular projects. Add comments when necessary, e.g.
complicated calculations or unreadable code (happens sometimes).

Angular by default creates TSLint rules, try to follow them as much as possible to keep the code somewhat
consistent. *Modern editors complain when you don't follow them anyway.*

## Roadmap

Upcoming features I'm planning to add (sorted by priority):

1. Turbine calculator
2. Molten salt planner (Heat, RF, Amount of coolant needed, ...)
3. Fusion calculator (fuel usage, RF/t, ...)
4. Actively cooled reactors

* Reactor optimizers (given a set of parameters find the fastest/most efficient/... reactor)

I might implement a lower priority feature first if I'm in the mood for it.
